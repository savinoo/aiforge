   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to chat**: Open `http://localhost:3000/chat`

3. **Demo mode is enabled**: No backend required! Everything works with mock data.

## Screenshot Scenarios

### 1. Empty State (Welcome Screen)
**URL**: `http://localhost:3000/chat`

**What to show**:
- Clean, modern interface
- AIForge logo centered
- Suggested questions
- Empty sidebar with upload area

**LinkedIn caption idea**:
> "Built a production-ready chat interface for AIForge in one session. RAG-powered, streaming responses, citation tracking. Next.js 15 + TypeScript + shadcn/ui. Ship faster. 🚀"

### 2. Chat with Streaming
**How to capture**:

### 3. Citations & Sources

## Tips for Great Screenshots

### Browser Setup

2. **Zoom level**: 100% for crisp text

4. **Dark mode**: Toggle with system settings to show both themes

### What to Capture
- ✅ Clean, uncluttered interface
- ✅ Real-looking content (use demo responses)
- ✅ Multiple message exchanges (not just one)
- ✅ Citations expanded to show RAG in action
- ✅ Documents in "Ready" state (green checkmarks)

### What to Avoid
- ❌ Console errors visible
- ❌ Empty chat (unless showing empty state)
- ❌ Broken layouts or cut-off text
- ❌ Lorem ipsum or placeholder text
- ❌ Developer tools open

## Mobile Screenshots (Bonus)

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M / Cmd+Shift+M)
3. Select iPhone 14 Pro or similar
4. Screenshot the mobile view with collapsed sidebar

**LinkedIn caption idea**:
> "Mobile-first. Built this chat interface to work perfectly on any device. Collapsible sidebar, touch-friendly controls, responsive layouts. 📱"

## Screenshot Tools

**macOS**:
- Cmd+Shift+4: Select area
- Cmd+Shift+4, then Space: Capture window with shadow

**Windows**:
- Win+Shift+S: Snipping tool
- Alt+PrtScn: Capture active window

**Browser Extensions**:

## Post-Processing (Optional)

1. **Add subtle shadow**: Makes screenshots pop
2. **Compress**: Use TinyPNG to reduce file size
3. **Annotations**: Add arrows/highlights for key features (use Figma, Canva, or Excalidraw)

## Ready-Made Captions

Copy-paste these for LinkedIn posts:

### Technical Deep-Dive
> "Building AIForge taught me that the best dev tools are invisible. This chat interface uses React 19's concurrent features, Next.js 15's app router, and shadcn/ui components. The result? 60fps streaming, zero layout shift, instant interactions. The stack matters less than the execution."

### Founder Story
> "Spent the last 2 months building AIForge — a Python AI SaaS boilerplate. RAG pipeline, AI agents, WhatsApp integration, all production-ready. Launching soon. The goal? Help developers ship AI products in days, not months. If you're building AI tools, this is for you."

### Feature Highlight
> "RAG without proper citations is dangerous. Every answer in AIForge shows its source documents with relevance scores. Click to expand, see the exact chunks used, verify the context. Trust through transparency."

### Builder Mindset
> "Ship > perfect. This chat interface took one focused session to build. Is it perfect? No. Is it good enough to launch? Yes. Stop over-engineering. Start shipping."

**Remember**: The goal is to show off your work, not just the product. Tell the story of *how* you built it, *why* decisions matter, and *what* you learned. People connect with the process, not just the result.

Good luck with your LinkedIn posts! 🚀
